For this challenge, I was tasked with creating an application to write and save notes. 

User Story

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
